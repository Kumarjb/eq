# Data for 2005, Sep 15th.

This is the same vol surface used in various illustrations in Chapter 3 and 4 by Jim Gatheral in his book *"The Volatility Surface: A Practitioner's Guide"*.

The fitted SVI parameters were noted from [The Baruch Volatility Workshop](https://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VW4.pdf) by Gatheral

The local vol parameters are calculated from the SVI parameters. See `src.model.localvol.py`.

The Bergomi parameters are calibrated using a [neural network trained by Romer](
